# Description:
The program movie2scan takes a movie of a laser scan during exactly one revolution and computes the corresponding point cloud. Moreover, it uses a simple (but not so good) algorithm to triangulate the points on the fly.

# Dependencies:
- Opencv >= 2.6.2
The file "cv_compatible.h" located in the "docs" folder must be put in the same folder than the original "cv.h", usually "/usr/include/opencv/".

# Compilation with cmake
$ cd movie2scan/
$ cmake .
$ make

# Usage
$ ./movie2scan movieFileName.webm calParamFileName.xml outputFileName
- movieFileName.webm: video file in webm format (other usual formats/codecs might be supported)
- calParamFileName.xml: XML file containing the 3x4 transformation matrix and the 3x1 normal vector. Those objects are generated after a calibration of the system camera+laser.
- outputFileName: this is the suffixe of the output, written without extension. Example : with "data", the program produces the files "data.xyz" and "data.mesh".
